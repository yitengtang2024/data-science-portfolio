# Data Processing and Preprocessing (ML A-Z)

**Goal:** Preprocess raw data to prepare it for machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

**Dataset:** `Data.csv` (contains country, age, salary, and purchase status)

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed:

- ✅ Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer` (mean strategy)
- ✅ Encoded categorical features with `OneHotEncoder` and `LabelEncoder`
- ✅ Scaled features with `StandardScaler`
- ✅ Split dataset into training and test sets (80/20)

---

## 📊 Result:

The dataset is now cleaned, numerically encoded, and scaled, ready for model training and evaluation.

## 📁 Files Included:

- `data_processing.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing preprocessing code
- `Data.csv` – sample input dataset
- (Optional) `X_train.csv`, `X_test.csv`, etc. – preprocessed outputs
